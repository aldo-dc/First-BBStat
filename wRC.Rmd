### Goal

The objective of this experiment is if Aaron's new stat BBPA has has more predictive power than other traditional stats such as OPS or avg when talking about fantasy points. We will be limiting our analysis Retrosheet play-by-play data base and the modern baseball era. Modern baseball era will be defined to be after and including 2000.

BBPA is defined as:

$$
BBPA = \frac{H + 2*2B + 3*3B + 4*HR + BB + IBB + HBP}{PA}
$$


```{r}
##  Filter to only include post 2000 baseball 
##  Calculating plate appearances
modern.era <- Batting %>%
  filter(yearID <=2019 & yearID >= 2000) %>%
  mutate(PA = AB + BB + IBB + HBP + SH + SF)
head(modern.era)
```
